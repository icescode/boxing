# A minimalist self played boxing game 

This is my learning Godot game engine in 17 days so far, don't expect more,  there are glitches, minimal animations and potentially bugs. What i've learned so far of Godot 

1. KinematicBody
2. Navigation Mesh
3. Ray Tracing
4. Animation Tree
5. Bone Attachment



The character and animations were downloaded from [mixamo](https://mixamo.com) , i combined the animation using [this combiner](https://nilooy.github.io/character-animation-combiner)  and run locally on my Linux Box.

I've used some lines of code from [Garbaj Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFgrpp1fpOI&list=PLZlYha_B4PAFlCqzYcb4xD2S6wRoa-us4) for navigation-mesh.
